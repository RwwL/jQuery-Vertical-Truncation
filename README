Chay's Vertical Truncation Demo
Feel free to try it in different browsers, with different fonts and and different zooms...

Important notes: 
* Make sure you create an empty span with the id: "vertruncWrapper" (with its associated style!)
* The longer your default/original text is, the longer it will take. I would advise having MySql/PHP/etc handle the majority of the truncation beforehand! 
* The styles within .truncTarget are important. Make sure you specify the margin, font, height, and width as I have!
* The package includes jquery.vertrunc.min.js as well. Use this if you don't need to see the full source. It's a (slightly) smaller file to include.
* I just realized, because of the dependancy on scrollHeight, that this won't work with anything before IE8. I'm sure there is some other solution to determine if there is a scrollbar, but I don't have time to research it right now...
